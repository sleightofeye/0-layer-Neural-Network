# 0-layer-Neural-Network
This program was built from scratch to train a 0 layer Neural Network to recognize digits from the MNIST database. 
It also autonomously tests parameters such as learning rate, batch size and number of epochs.
It also takes the best parameters W, and b for a given set of alpha, batch size and epoch number, and displays the probability space for a given digit (the digit prototype created by the program).
